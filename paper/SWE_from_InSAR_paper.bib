	abstract = {Snow depth and Snow Water Equivalence (SWE) are important parameters for hydrological applications. In this application, a theoretical method of snow depth estimation with repeat-pass InSAR measurements was proposed, and a preliminary sensitivity analysis of snow phase changes versus the incident angle and snow density was developed. Moreover, the snow density and incident angle parameters were analyzed and calibrated, and the local incident angle was used as a substitute for the satellite incident angle to improve the snow depth estimation. From the results, the coherence images showed that a high degree of coherence can be found for dry snow, and, apart from the effect of snow, land use/cover change due to a long temporal baseline and geometric distortion due to the rugged terrain were the main constraints for InSAR technique to measure snow depth and SWE in this area. The result of snow depth estimation between July 2008 and February 2009 demonstrated that the average snow depth was about 20 cm, which was consistent with the field survey results. The areal coverage of snow distribution estimated from the snow depth and SWE results was consistent with snow cover obtained from HJ-1A CCD optical data at the same time.},

	abstract = {This paper describes the theoretical relation between interferometric phase and changes in snow water equivalent (SWE) and show results from experiments using ERS- 1/2 tandem data. The main scattering contribution from a dry snow cover is from the snow-ground interface. However, the radar wave will be refracted in the snow. Thus, only small changes in the snow properties between two interferometric synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images will change the interferometric phase. This phase change is shown to introduce a significantly increase in the digital elevation model (DEM) height error, although no effects are observed on the degree of coherence. The phase change is also shown to affect the differential interferometric results and may wrongly be interpreted as range displacement. The presented theory and results implies that light snowfall and/or small changes in snow properties between interferometric SAR (InSAR) image acquisitions, may introduce significant height errors in DEM derived from glaciers, ice sheets, or bare ground, even in the case of high degree of coherence. Thus, meteorological observations in addition to degree of coherence must be considered when generating DEM in areas covered with snow or where snow fall is likely to have occurred.},

	abstract = {In this work we present a methodology for the mapping of Snow Water Equivalent (SWE) temporal variations based on the Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Interferometry technique and Sentinel-1 data. The shift in the interferometric phase caused by the refraction of the microwave signal penetrating the snow layer is isolated and exploited to generate maps of temporal variation of SWE from coherent SAR interferograms. The main advantage of the proposed methodology with respect to those based on the inversion of microwave SAR backscattering models is its simplicity and the reduced number of required in-situ SWE measurements. The maps, updated up to every 6 days, can attain a spatial resolution up to 20 m with sub-centimetre ΔSWE measurement accuracy in any weather and sun illumination condition. We present results obtained using the proposed methodology over a study area in Finland. These results are compared with in-situ measurements of ΔSWE, showing a reasonable match with a mean accuracy of about 6 mm.},

	abstract = {The feasibility for retrieving the mass of snow on ground (the snow water equivalent, SWE) by means of repeat-pass SAR interferometry has been investigated. Because the SAR signal of ground covered by dry snow is dominated by backscatter from the snow/ground interface, the differential phase shift due to propagation in the snow can be directly related to SWE. The factors of relevance for coherence of snow covered areas were studied by theoretical modeling and analysis of repeat pass SAR data, showing that the C-band coherence often deteriorates rapidly in case of snow fall whereas coherence is much better preserved at L-band. Case studies on SWE retrieval are presented for 3-day repeatpass ERS SAR data of the Austrian Alps and 4-month repeat-pass L-band airborne SAR data of Oberpfaffenhofen. The investigations confirm the potential of repeat-pass InSAR data for mapping SWE with high spatial detail, suggesting clear preference for L-band. For fully assessing the InSAR capabilities for SWE retrieval, dedicated experiments with co-located, spatially detailed field measurements need to be carried out.},
